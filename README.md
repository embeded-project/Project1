# Project First phase details 
We defined a start and ending point for our path and between them there's turning points we will read location at start and end of each subpath in the main path and the technique will be uploaded in the second milestone then summing up all distances.
When the distance covered between the start and end point exceeds 100m we display 100 on lcd and turn red led on.
Total distance is summation of subpaths distances.
We tested each function alone to test LCD and LED.
Function Verification: 
We verify the function by turning on LED when distance exceeds 100m. 
We verify the function displaying number 100 on LCD when distance exceeds 100m. 
Finally we do both when distance exceeds 100 m.
